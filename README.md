# Tello-Facial-Recognizer

The drone was running on 7% battery so there was no way of flying so I held the drone like I was taking a selfie. I dumped the stream to a file. After getting the .mp4 file I ran the Python3 script to see if it recognized me and it did!

## Goals
* ~~Control Drone With Xbox Controller~~
* ~~Stream Video~~
* ~~Stream Video While Flying~~
* ~~Facial Recoginition~~
* ~~Facial Recoginition With Drone Camera~~
* Stream And Recognize Real Time
* I'll Come Up With Some More Goals Later
